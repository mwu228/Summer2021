Black Lab summer project - https://pharmacy.uky.edu/people/penni-black

Version 0.3.0 - 
I uploaded the TCPA dataset into Jupyter Lab and started playing around with a real datafile. I ended at retrieving most of the protein list. Most because in the row with protein names, there are 4 columns that are used to ID the patients, cancer type, etc., so I'm now looking into pandas (Python Data Analysis Library) package for better dataset processing.
