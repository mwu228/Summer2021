# Summer 2021
## [Black Lab](https://pharmacy.uky.edu/people/penni-black) summer project - 

**Version 0.5.1**
Took out all the fluff and failed tries so the code so far is readable. I have the "genes of interest for both JAK2 and STAT3 in separate arrays.
**Version 0.5.0**
Got the correlations of each gene with respect to JAK2 to print out. Next step is grabbing the "genes of interest" and doing it for STAT3

**Version 0.4.0**
Just combined the main script file with pandas intro file so I have a single, working file. I'm using TCPA to test everything. Right now, I have a list of all the gene names for use in the graph part down the road. Going to work on the stats stuff next.

**Version 0.3.0**
I uploaded the TCPA dataset into Jupyter Lab and started playing around with a real datafile. I ended at retrieving most of the protein list. Most because in the row with protein names, there are 4 columns that are used to ID the patients, cancer type, etc., so I'm now looking into pandas (Python Data Analysis Library) package for better dataset processing.
